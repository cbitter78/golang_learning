# Learning GoLang
Back in 2016 I started learning GoLang.  I wrote my notes in the repo [golang_cheet_sheet](https://github.com/cbitter78/golang_cheat_sheet).  Sense that time I have busy with a few other things.  Its now time (Jan 2022) to refresh my GoLang skills.

I am working through the this [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/) corse with a few frends.   This repo is where I will keep my notes and example projects.
